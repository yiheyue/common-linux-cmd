# About commands

A command can be one of four different types:

1. An executable program

2. A command built into the shell itself (shell builtin)

3. A shell function

4. An alias

## type

> type (built-in) - display the kind of a command

This command can display the kind of command.

e.g. display the kind of these commands

```
user@pc ~ $ type type
type is a shell builtin

user@pc ~ $ type ll
ll is aliased to `ls -alF'

user@pc ~ $ type cp
cp is hashed (/usr/cp)
```

## which

> which (1) - locate a command

Sometimes there is more than one version of an executable program installed on a system. While this is not very common on desktop systems, itâ€™s not unusual on large servers.

The `which` command can determine the exact location of a given executable program.

e.g. get the exact location of these commands

```
user@pc ~ $ which which
/usr/bin/which

user@pc ~ $ which tree
/usr/bin/tree
```

## help

> help (built-in) - display the documentation of a built-in

The `help` command can get the documentation of the built-in commands.

e.g. display the documentation of `cd`

```
user@pc ~ $ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
...
...
```

- `--help` option - many executable programs support this option to display the common usage

## man

> man (1) - an interface to the on-line reference manuals

For most executable programs, you can get their documentations from `man` command.

e.g. display the documentation of `man`

```
user@pc ~ $ man man
```

## apropos

> apropos (1) - search the manual page names and descriptions

Use `apropos` command can match the exact command that you search.

Its function is the same as `man -k command`.

e.g. match `aprop`

```
user@pc ~ $ apropos aprop
apropos (1) - search the manual page names and descriptions
```

## whatis

> whatis (1) - display one-line manual page descriptions

e.g. display the simple description about `whatis`

```
user@pc ~ $ whatis whatis
whatis (1) - display one-line manual page descriptions
```

## whereis

> whereis (1) - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command

e.g. locate the binary, source, and manual page files of `tree`

```
user@pc ~ $ whereis tree
tree: /usr/bin/tree /usr/share/man/man1/tree.1.gz
```

## info

> info (1) - read Info documents

The GNU Project provides an alternative to man pages for their programs, called "info".
